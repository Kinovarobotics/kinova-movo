# Personal safety and security of MOVO

This section covers key information and principles to follow to avoid personal injury or damage to MOVO.

This section deals with basic principles of safety and security when handling and operating MOVO. Here we'll speak about:

-   Intended use of MOVO
-   Appropriate environmental and operating conditions for MOVO
-   E-Stop
-   Avoiding damage to the equipment
-   Avoiding personal injury

The items mentioned in this section shouldn't be thought of as an exhaustive list. Part of the idea of MOVO is that researchers will use their creativity and use MOVO in ways we could never have even imagined. For the most part, it boils down to a few basic principles - be attentive, be careful, and use your common sense.

So play safe, be nice to MOVO, and above all else - have fun.

-   **[Intended use](../Concepts/c_intended_use.md)**  
This section describes the intended usage of MOVO.
-   **[Environmental and operating conditions](../Concepts/c_environmental_operating_conditions.md)**  
This section describes the proper environmental operating conditions for MOVO. Make sure not to use MOVO outside the proper range of conditions.
-   **[E-Stop](../Concepts/c_estop.md)**  
This section describes the use of the E-Stop. The E-Stop lets you stop MOVO quickly in an emergency.
-   **[Avoiding damage to MOVO](../Concepts/c_avoiding_damage_equipment.md)**  
This section describes steps to take to avoid potential damage to MOVO. Most of this is common sense, but it's good to keep in mind.
-   **[Avoiding personal injury](../Concepts/c_avoiding_personal_injury.md)**  
This section describes some basic steps to take to avoid potential injury to researchers and bystanders when operating MOVO.
