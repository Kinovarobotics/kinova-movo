# Avoiding personal injury

This section describes some basic steps to take to avoid potential injury to researchers and bystanders when operating MOVO.

MOVO is reasonably safe to operate. However, when operating MOVO, some common-sense steps should be taken to minimize the chance of injury to researchers and bystanders.

Keep a safe distance away from MOVO in general.

-   When moving MOVO in the box, be careful moving the box on an incline, so that the box does not roll away. The box with MOVO is quite heavy and could be dangerous if a person is pinned between the box and a wall.
-   MOVO will tend to roll on a steep incline if the power is cut.
-   MOVO is heavy. Don't try to lift MOVO.
-   Be attentive and alert while around MOVO. While trying out new applications, movements might be unpredictable until you get used to it. The motion base of MOVO and the arms are limited in their velocity, but remain attentive to avoid collisions with people when controlling with tele-operation. Avoid being in the path or close vicinity of MOVO.
-   All people near MOVO should remain aware of where the robot is in relation to their body.
-   Keep all animals away from MOVO. Children and visitors should not be around MOVO unless supervised. Don't let children or visitors operate MOVO. Don't let anyone ride on MOVO.
-   Be careful of MOVO running into people. Only adults should be in the area while MOVO is running. Don't let the robot grab or hit another person with the arms. Don't drive MOVO into someone's body.
-   Be careful when MOVO is lifting objects in case the object falls or is dropped.
-   Be careful of pinching with the robotic arm wrist and fingers.
-   Keep fingers, hair, and loose clothing away from wheels, gears, or any pinch points.
-   Don't stop or park MOVO in front of an emergency exit or in the middle of a passageway. MOVO is heavy, and may be difficult to move or maneuver around in an emergency.
-   Take precautions to avoid electric shock when removing MOVO's skin. Be careful when working around MOVO without the skin panels on.
-   Pay attention to all warning labels.
-   Don't operate dangerous items or equipment with MOVO. Don't carry sharp, very hot / cold, or chemically hazardous objects and materials in MOVO's hands.
