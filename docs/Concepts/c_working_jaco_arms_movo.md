# Working with JACO arms and MOVO

This section describes how to perform procedures relating to removing and installing JACO arms from and on MOVO.

MOVO works with the same standard JACO arms used by Innovation researchers. Existing JACO arms can be mounted on MOVO, and conversely, arms on MOVO can be taken off and mounted on a tabletop for research purposes. For this, procedures are required for removing and installing JACO arms.

-   **[Disconnect JACO arm from standard controller base](../Tasks/t_disconnect_jaco_standard_base.md)**  
This page describes how to disconnect a JACO arm from a standard JACO controller base. This is necessary to prepare an arm to be mounted on MOVO.
-   **[Installing Kinova arms on MOVO](../Tasks/t_kinova_arms_install.md)**  
This section describes the process of installing Kinova arms on MOVO. This applies whether you are putting the arms on for the first time, or if you are putting the arms back on after removing them.
-   **[Removing Kinova arms from MOVO](../Tasks/t_kinova_arms_uninstall.md)**  
This section describes the procedure for removing one Kinova arm from MOVO. This can be helpful if you want to experiment with the arm separately for research purposes.
-   **[Mounting JACO arm on standard controller base](../Tasks/t_mount_jaco_externally_base.md)**  
This page describes how to mount a JACO arm on a standard JACO controller base.
