# Battery breaker switch

This section describes how to flip the battery breaker on the base. This is required in order for the batteries to be charged, and for MOVO to operate without being plugged in.

There is a main breaker switch for the power system on the motion base of MOVO, on MOVO's right hand side.

For safety reasons, MOVO is shipped with the breaker turned OFF. You need to flip the breaker switch before being able to charge MOVO or operate without being plugged in.

The breaker switch is on the inner frame of the MOVO base, underneath the bottom skin panels. If you reach behind the lower skin panel, you will be able to feel it, roughly 10 cm in front of the rear wheel, somewhere behind the LED panel. The switch goes left to right, with the right being the OFF position. Hook the switch with your finger and flip it left to turn the breaker ON.

Next, make sure to plug MOVO in to charge the batteries.
