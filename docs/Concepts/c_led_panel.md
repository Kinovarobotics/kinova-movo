# LED panel

This section describes the LED status indicators on the right hand side of the motion base of MOVO.

On the right side of the motion base of MOVO are several LEDs. These give information about:

-   The status of MOVO - indicated by one green LED. Solid green when powered on, and pulsing green when charging.
-   The state of charge of MOVO - indicated by four green LEDs \(the number of green LEDs that are illuminated gives an indication of the level of charge\).

    **Note:** When MOVO is plugged in for charging, the four state of charge LEDs will blink in a wave sequence until the batteries are fuly charged, at which point they indicate solid green.
