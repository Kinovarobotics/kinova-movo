# Charging MOVO's battery

This section describes the procedure to charge MOVO's battery. MOVO's batteries need to be charged regularly.

On removing MOVO from the box, you need to connect MOVO to a power source to charge the batteries.

**Note:** MOVO has two Lithium ion batteries located on the motion base.

**Note:** In regular use, the battery life is about 5 hours. In standby, the battery life is about 8 hours. Safety mechanisms in the charging system should generally prevent the battery from discharging below a minimum level, but there are limits to this.

**Note:** Allowing the battery to discharge deeply may cause permanent damage to the battery. Be sure to always keep the battery at least partially charged. You need to plug MOVO in **at least** once per month. Generally, as a habit, you should plug it in whenever not in use.

**Note:** Use only the power supply provided in the box with MOVO.

1.   Locate the power supply, and plug it into a standard wall outlet near MOVO. 
2.   Connect the power supply into the charging port on the left hand side of the base of MOVO. While the batteries are charging, the four green State of Charge LEDs on the right hand side of the base will blink in a wave sequence. ![](../Graphics/power_connector.svg) 
3.   Leave MOVO to charge until the four State of Charge indicator LEDs all indicate solid green. ![](../Graphics/LED_panel.svg) 

    **Note:** The power converter will become quite warm if charging for an extended period of time. Be careful when touching the power supply after MOVO has been plugged in for a while.
