# Removing Kinova arms from MOVO

This section describes the procedure for removing one Kinova arm from MOVO. This can be helpful if you want to experiment with the arm separately for research purposes.

-   You will need a 5 mm hex key to remove the screw holding the mounting base of the Kinova arm onto MOVO.
-   You will need a 2.5 mm hex key to remove screws holding the Kinova arms onto the dummy base.
-   This procedure is easier with two people.
-   Remove the torso skin panels to obtain access to the arm mountings on the front of MOVO.

It can be useful to remove the Kinova arm\(s\) from MOVO. A Kinova arm can be connected to the separate JACO controller base and mounted on a table. You can use this to experiment with the JACO arm independently for research purposes. This procedure will describe how to remove one arm. The procedure to remove a second arm is identical.

1.   Unplug the power/controls connector on the top of the base. Squeeze the plastic tab in the middle of the connector and pull the connector out gently to disconnect. 
2.   Use a 5 mm hex key to remove the screw on top holding the base on to MOVO. ![](../Graphics/arm_base_disconnect.svg) 
3.   Pull the robotic arm and the base off of MOVO. Set the arm and base on a workbench to continue. 
4.   The robotic arm is held onto the base with several screws. At the first actuator of the arm, you will need to remove the ring of screws on the side of the dummy base. \(You need to leave the other ring of screws connected to keep the first actuator attached to the arm\) The heads of the screws take a 2.5 mm hex key. If you have received MOVO with arms included, Loctite adhesive will have been applied to the screws to hold them in place and prevent them from coming loose under vibrations. When removing the screws, you will need to apply a little bit of extra torque to break the bond, while taking care not to over-torque and strip the screws. ![](../Graphics/arm_and_base_disconnect.svg) 
5.   With the screws removed, pull the arm carefully and slowly away from the base. 

    **Note:** Do this slowly so as not to damage the flex cable that connects the two.

6.   Pull out the small plastic tabs on the side of the actuator connector to loosen the flex cable. Carefully disconnect the flex cable on the side of the first actuator. You can leave the flex cable connected to the base. 

You can now mount the JACO arm onto the separate standard JACO controller base.
