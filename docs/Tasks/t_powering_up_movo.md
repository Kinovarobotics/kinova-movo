# Powering up MOVO

This section describes the procedure for powering up MOVO. This is carried out every time you turn MOVO on.

-   You should start MOVO on a flat surface.
-   If the E-Stop has previously been engaged, you need to disengage the E-Stop before starting up by twisting the E-Stop to the right until the button pops out.

    **Note:** As a safety precaution, the E-Stop will have been engaged before shipping. Make sure to disengage the E-Stop before your first power up after unboxing and charging MOVO.


1.   Check that the arms are hanging straight down in front of MOVO, and not crossed over each other. 

    **Note:** During the startup process, the arms will both rise up into the homing position. There is no built-in collision avoidance for the arms, whether in the arms themselves or in MOVO in general. If the arms are crossed over, they will collide and you may damage the actuators in the arms.

2.   Press the power button on the HMI panel on the rear upper torso of MOVO. This will initiate the internal startup processes for MOVO, as described in more detail elsewhere. A ring around the power button should flash blue, and the status LED will flash, first yellow, and then alternating yellow and green. ![](../Graphics/power_on_off.svg) 
3.   As the arms begin to rise to the homing position, supervise to ensure the arms do not collide. 

After completing this procedure, MOVO will be powered on.
