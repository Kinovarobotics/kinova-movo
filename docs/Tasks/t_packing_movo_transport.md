# Packing up MOVO for transport

This section describes the procedure for packing up MOVO into its shipping container. This is useful if you ever need to ship or transport MOVO.

-   You will need the shipping box in which MOVO arrived.
-   The box should be on a level surface.
-   Engage the brakes on the wheels under the front of the box so that the box won't roll excessively while putting MOVO into the box. You will probably want to have another person to help you with this procedure.
-   Lower MOVO to its minimum height and then power down MOVO.

If you ever need to transport or ship MOVO to another location, you will need to pack MOVO back into the shipping box to minimize the chance that MOVO is not damaged in transit.

1.   Twist the latches on the door to open the box. 
2.   Lower the ramp to the floor. 
3.   Open the smaller storage box inside the box and place the accessories \(Joystick, power supply, tools\) inside it. Close the small box and close the velcro fastener. 
4.   Turn MOVO around so that the back of MOVO is facing the box. 
5.   Line up MOVO square with the ramp and push to roll MOVO up the ramp. It will probably be helpful to have another person hold the box while you push. 
6.   Once MOVO is inside the box, push MOVO to the back of the container. Make sure MOVO is snugly fit in between the packing on the side. 
7.   Place the foam for packing the arms over the arms. Make sure the outward face of the foam is flush with the front opening of the box. 
8.   Lift up the ramp and secure it in place. 
9.   Close the door of the box. Ensure nothing is sticking out of the sides of the box. Turn the latches on the side of the door clockwise to latch and flip the handles flat to secure them. 

MOVO will now be packed up for transport.
