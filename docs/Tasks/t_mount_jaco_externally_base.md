# Mounting JACO arm on standard controller base

This page describes how to mount a JACO arm on a standard JACO controller base.

-   To work with a JACO externally from MOVO, you will need to mount the JACO base to a table, desk, or workbench in such a way that it is stable and firmly held in place. For this you will need:
    -   A table-top mounting plate \(optional accessory - those who already have JACO arms for research will probably already have one of these\).
    -   A JACO power supply \(optional accessory - again, those who already have JACO arms for research will already have one of these\)
    -   a JACO controller base \(included with each JACO arm, in the box if MOVO was purchased with arms\)
-   The JACO arm will need to have already been removed from MOVO.
-   You will need a 2.5 mm hex key and 2.5 mm screws.

This procedure will be used when you want to remove an arm from MOVO to experiment the arm in isolation.

1.   Fix the mounting plate to the table, desk, or workbench as described in the JACO2 Innovation User Guide. 
2.   Mount the JACO2 controller base to the mounting plate, as described in the JACO2 Innovation User Guide. 
3.   Connect the flex cable from the base to the first actuator of the arm. 

    **Note:** Ensure that the flex cable is connected the right way up with respect to the first actuator. There are two sides to the end of the flex cable. One side is blue, and the other is metallic. As you look at the exposed face of the first actuator, the metallic side of the flex cable should be showing as you insert the cable into the connector.

4.   Being careful not to pinch the slack in the flex cable connecting the arm to the base, lower the arm into place on top of the base. 
5.   Insert and tighten screws on the aluminum ring on the lower side of the actuator using a 2.5 mm hex key to affix the arm to the base. 
6.   Replace the grey plastic ring cover over the actuator. 

The arm is now mounted on a base on a mounting plate.

Connect the arm power supply to the arm base power connector and a development machine to the arm base via USB to begin experimenting.
