# Unboxing MOVO

This section gives a description of the process for removing MOVO from the shipping container.

The box should be on a level surface. Engage the brakes on the wheels under the front of the box to help ensure that the box won't loveexcessively while unboxing MOVO.

1.   Locate the door side of the box and open the latches on the door. Release the latches on the door by flipping the latch handle out and then turning counter-clockwise to release. Repeat this for both latches. 
2.   Slowly open the door while maintaining the ramp in its raised position. 
3.   Lower the ramp to the ground. This will let you step up to remove MOVO, and allow you to roll MOVO out of the box. 
4.   Remove the foam cover from the arms. \(Or from the area where the arms usually go, if you purchased MOVO without arms\) 

    **Note:** Conserve the shipping foam inside the box in case you ever need to ship or transport MOVO.

    **Note:** The arms can fall down when MOVO is not powered on. Be careful to keep the arms from falling.

5.   Once the foam is removed, you can pull on the main body \(torso\) of MOVO to free MOVO from the packing. MOVO is secured relatively tightly in the packing foam to prevent movement during shipping, so you may need to pull hard. You will probably want to have another person to help you by holding the box while you pull. Make sure to pull on the body of MOVO rather than the robotic arms \(If your MOVO came with arms\). 
6.   Pull MOVO slowly down the ramp and away from the box. 
7.   Once you have removed MOVO from the box, you will see a container within the shipping box at the back. This contains the other accessories which ship with MOVO \(joystick controller, JACO arm bases, MOVO power supply, etc\) 

Having removed MOVO from the box, you will want to locate the power supply from the inner box. After flipping on the main breaker on the base \(see details on following page\), you can connect the power supply to a standard wall outlet and plug MOVO in to charge. For safety reasons, MOVO may be shipped with the battery only partly charged.

CAUTION:

-   Deep discharge risk
-   Do not let the Li-Ion batteries discharge fully. Make sure to recharge the battery as soon as reasonably possible.

If your MOVO was purchased without arms, then a closed rubber cover will have been placed over the arm holes on the front for shipping. You will want to keep these rubber covers for use with any of your own JACO arms that you want to install on MOVO. You will however need to cut out the front of the cover with an utility knife to open a hole for the arm to pass through the rubber ring. Cut following the contour of the circular inner section.
