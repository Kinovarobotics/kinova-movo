# Powering down MOVO

This section describes the procedure for an orderly shut down of MOVO. This is used whenever it is necessary to shut down and put away MOVO when not in use.

There are two ways to shut down MOVO. There is the regular shutdown, initiated by pressing in the silver colored power button on the HMI panel at the rear of MOVO. And then there is emergency shutdown, initiated by pushing the E-stop. This topic describes an orderly, planned shutdown.

-   You should be on a flat surface near where you will normally park and charge MOVO.
-   MOVO should not be holding any objects with its arm\(s\).
-   Although you can shut down MOVO reasonably easily with one person, you might find it easier with two.

1.   Press the power button to shut off the power. ![](../Graphics/power_on_off.svg) 
2.   The arms will begin to gently fall. Cradle the arms with your hands to support them as they fall, and preventing them from colliding with each other, with MOVO's skin, and with the ground. 

After completing this procedure, MOVO will be powered down.

After powering down, make sure to plug in MOVO to the power supply to recharge the batteries.
