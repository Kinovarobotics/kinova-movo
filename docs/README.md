This site is being used to experiment with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation as a place to hold development documentation information as an alternative to the repository Wiki pages (as is done currently)

The docs published from this folder may be viewed [here](https://kinovarobotics.github.io/kinova-movo/)

This area should be considered experimental. For the most up-to-date documentation on MOVO, see the Wiki pages at:
- [https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-movo/wiki](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-movo/wiki) (Computer and software setup and instructions on interfacing with the robot through code interfaces) and 
- the HTML user guide [https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-movo/blob/master/MOVO_user_guide.zip](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-movo/blob/master/MOVO_user_guide.zip) (A zip package containing the HTML package of the user guide. Primarily hardware related information and hardware setup / configuration)

Depending on the results of this experiment, some or all the MOVO documentation resources may be migrated here. Check out this space for any updates.
