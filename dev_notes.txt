# SSH'ing into the movos
Make sure you are connected to the robohub wifi
movo1 can be reached by `ssh robohub@movo1`
movo2 can be reached by `ssh robohub@movo2`

# Camera
Camera uses the realsense-ros pkg
Can be launched with <roslaunch movo_bringup movo2.launch as part of movo>
Can be launched with <roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch filters:=pointcloud>
run <realsense-viewer> on a computer with realsense plugged in to use the intel realsense GUI

# ROS Install
This metapackage uses vcstool to keep track of 3rd party packages that must be built from source
See ROS page on vcstool for context
Repositories can be imported with "vcs import src/ < src/kinova-movo/movo.rosinstall" from the root of the ws

# Moving the base
## Kinova Test Script
Assert that the robot is not charging
Assert estop is not engaged
On movo1, run <roslaunch movo_bringup movo1.launch>
On movo1, run <rosrun si_utils base_motion_test.py>
## Command Line Publishing
Assert that the robot is not charging
Assert estop is not engaged
On movo1, run <roslaunch movo_bringup movo1.launch>
On movo1, run <rostopic pub /movo/gp_command movo_msgs/ConfigCmd '{gp_cmd: "GENERAL_PURPOSE_CMD_SET_OPERATIONAL_MODE", gp_param: 5}'>
on movo1, run <rostopic pub -r 10 /movo/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.5}}'>
## Using RVIZ Interactive Markers (preferred)
Assert estop is not engaged
On movo1, run <roslaunch movo_bringup movo1.launch>
On the visualization computer, ensure your movo_ws is sourced (since the robot_model uses stl and dae files on the visualization computer)
On the visualization computer, run <rosrun rviz rviz -d $(rospack find movo_viz)/rviz/robot.rviz>
Ensure "Interactive" mode is selected from the top menu of the RVIZ window
Put the base in "Tractor Mode" by clicking the box rendered above the movo then mode->tractor
Move the movo with the interactive markers

# Moving the torso
Assert that the robot is not charging
Assert estop is not engaged
On movo1, run <roslaunch movo_bringup movo1.launch>
On movo1, run <rosrun si_utils torso_jtas_test.py>

# Moving the gimbal
Assert that the robot is not charging
Assert estop is not engaged
On movo1, run <roslaunch movo_bringup movo1.launch>
On movo1, run <rosrun si_utils head_jtas_test.py>

# Connecting personal PC to movo1 master
This is temporary and assumes movo1 is the ROS master. It does not care about about movo2
On movo1:
Ensure this is done on every terminal where ROS is running
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.97.71.49:11311
export ROS_IP=129.97.71.49
On your laptop:
Ensure you've run all your source commands (ie. source devel/setup.bash). These other files can overwrite the following env var settings.
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.97.71.49:11311
export ROS_IP=<your ip address in same subnet as movo1>
